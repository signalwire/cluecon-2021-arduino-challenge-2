# Cluecon 2021 Arduino Challenge 2
Using an Arduino board, and sensors create a solution that will allow you to detect the purity of water.  You can use your imagination and any code snippets provided to aid in your quest.   There are many different ways to solve the objective, Be creative and have fun with it!


## About Cluecon 2021 Arduino Challenge 2
For this challenge you will demonstrate your technical skills to measure the purity of drinking water.

Our examples will show you how to test the resistance, and temperature or water. However, feel free to go further, and test other factors related to purity.

- [x] Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 or Similar
- [x] Micro USB Cable
- [x] Jumper/Hookup Wires

## Cluecon 2021 Arduino Challenge 2 - How It Works
When water has impurities, minerals or additives, it becomes more conductive to electricity.  For this challenge, we would like to make water that has the least resistance.  We can use distilled water as a control. 
To calculate we will create a simple ohm meter. Our ohm meter will take a known resistance, and allow us to calculate the unknown resistance.  

## Let's Get Started 
Prepare Your Coding Enviroment
1. Install Arduio IDE 
- [Installing Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/windows)
2. Then open and goto Tools -> Boards -> Boards Manager
3. Type in 'MKR' and make sure that 'Arduino SAMD Boards (32-bits ARM Cortex-M0+)' is Installed, If not click install

4. Take inventory and prepare your sensors for what you need
5. Code! - There are examples included, to get you started, and we are here to help.
